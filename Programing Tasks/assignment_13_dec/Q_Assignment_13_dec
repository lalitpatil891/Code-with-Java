Assignment :
----------------------
Develop a scenario based program by using Method Overloading for processing the payment
using different available options like Cash Payment, Credit Card and Debit Card Payment.

Create one BLC class called Payment.

Write 3 overloaded methods makePayment()

1) Method Name        : makePayment()
Argument        : 1 argument of type double amount
Return Type        : void
Access modifier    : public
In this method validate the parameter variable by using one Helper method (private
method) validateAmount() to take only positive amount [Description is given below]

2) Method Name        : makePayment()
Argument        : 3 arguments [String cardHolderName, String creditCardNumber,double amount]
Return Type        : void
Access modifier    : public
In this method validate the parameter variable amount and creditCardNumber through
Helper methods, amount must be positive integer and creditCardNumber must be of
16 digits exactly.

3) Method Name        : makePayment()
Argument        : 2 arguments [String debitCardNumber, double amount]
Return Type        : void
Access modifier    : public
In this method validate the parameter variable amount and debitCardNumber though
Helper methods, amount must be positive integer and debitCardNumber must be of
16 digits exactly.

HELPER METHODS (Must be private so accessible from inside Payment class only)
[For more about helper method, read the notes, Access modifier topic, public access modifier]

1) Method Name    : validateAmount()
Argument        : 1 argument double amount
Return Type    : boolean
Access modifier    : private
In this method validate the amount, if amount is 0 or less than 0, print an error
message and return false otherwise return true.

2) Method Name    : validateCardNumber()
Argument        : 1 argument String cardNumber.
Return Type    : boolean
Access modifier    : private
In this method validate the card number for its length, if length is exactly 16 digits
then return true otherwise return false.

3) Method Name    : maskCardNumber()
Argument        : 1 argument String cardNumber.
Return Type    : String
Access modifier    : private
By using this method we should display only last 4 digit of card (Credit OR Debit both)
only.[See the Test cases for more details in the below of this question]

Create an ELC class called PaymentProcess.

Inside main method display the following details as a Menu.
System.out.println("Payment Menu");
System.out.println("Please select any one Payment Method from the Menu :");
System.out.println("\t\t 1) Payment by using Cash ");
System.out.println("\t\t 2) Payment by using Credit Card ");
System.out.println("\t\t 3) Payment by using Debit Card ");

Write Switch case with Scanner class to make the payment through different Options :
