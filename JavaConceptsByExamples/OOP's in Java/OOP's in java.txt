Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)
----------------------------------
What is an Object?
------------------
An object is a physical entity which exist in the real world.
Example :- Pen, Car, Laptop, Mouse, Fan and so on

An Object is having 3 characteristics :

   a) Identification of the Object (Name of the Object)
   b) State of the Object (Data OR Properties OR Variable of Object)
   c) Behavior of the Object (Functionality of the Object)

OOP is a technique through which we can design or develop the programs using class and object.

Writing programs on real life objects is known as Object Oriented Programming.

Here in OOP we concentrate on objects rather than function/method.

Advantages of OOP :
-------------------
1) Modularity  (Dividing the bigger task into smaller task)
2) Reusability (We can reuse the component so many times)
3) Flexibility (Easy to maintain [By using interface])

Features of OOP :
-----------------
1) Class
2) Object
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation
5) Inheritance
6) Polymorphism

Steps for creating Object Orineted Programming

Step 1 :-  Create the Object based on the BLC class inside ELC
           class.[main method]

Step 2 :- Define all the object properties and behavior inside
          the BLC class based on your imagination.

Step 3 :- Initialize all the object properties with user friendly value by using reference variable.

step 4 :- call the behavior (calling the methods)
