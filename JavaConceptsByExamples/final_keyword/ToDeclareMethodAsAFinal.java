/**
2) To declare a method as a final (Overriding is not possible)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever we declare a method as a final then we can't override that method in the sub class otherwise there will be a compilation error.

We should declare a method as a final if the body of the method i.e the implementation of the method is very important and we don't want to override or change the super class method body by sub class method body then we should declare the super class method as final method.
