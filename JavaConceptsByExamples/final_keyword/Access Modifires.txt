Notes - Access modifires
------------------------
Access Modifiers in Java are used to control the visibility of fields, methods, classes and constructors.


| Modifier                  | Visible To                                         | Visibility Level |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **private**               | Only within the same class                         | 🔒 Lowest        |
| **default** (no modifier) | Same package                                       | 🟡 Medium        |
| **protected**             | Same package + subclasses (even in other packages) | 🟠 Higher        |
| **public**                | Everywhere                                         | 🔓 Highest       |


+ protected means accessible in same package + subclasses,

We can’t create sub classes to that class which has only private constructors.
Inner classes can be private, but outer classes can not be private.
protected members of a class are inherited to any sub class.
private inner Class B can not be instantiated outside the Class A.
Class with default (no) access modifiers can not have subclass outside the package.
We can declare a class as protected but only inner class. Outer class can not be protected.
protected members of a class are inherited to sub classes outside the package.
we can’t instantiate a class outside the package which has only protected constructors.
static members of a class can be private.
 A .java file can have maximum one public class.
private methods are not at all inherited.
Outer class can’t be private.
