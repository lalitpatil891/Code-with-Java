/**

3) To declare a variable/Field as a final :
--------------------------------------------
In older languages like C and C++ we use "const" keyword to declare a constant variable but in java, const is a reserved word for future use so instead of const we should use "final" keyword.

If we declare a variable as a final then we can't perform re-assignment (i.e nothing but re-initialization) of that variable.

In java It is always a better practise to declare a final variable by uppercase letter according to the naming convention.
