/**

1) To declare a class as a final :
-----------------------------------
Whenever we declare a class as a final class then we cann't extend or inherit that class otherwise we will get a compilation error.

We should declare a class as a final if the composition of the class (logic of the class) is very important and we don't want to share the feature of the class to some other developer to modify the original behavior of the existing class, In that situation we should declare a class as a final.

Declaring a class as a final does not mean that the variables and methods declared inside the class will also become as a final, only the class behavior is final that means we can modify the variables value as well as we can create the object for the final classes.

Note :- In java String and All wrapper classes are declared as final class.
