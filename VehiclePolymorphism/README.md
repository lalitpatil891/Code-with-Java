## 🚀 **Dynamic Polymorphism in Java – Vehicle Interface Example**  

### 📌 **Overview**  
This Java program demonstrates **dynamic polymorphism** using an interface `Vehicle` and its implementing classes (`Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`). The `VehicleTest` class dynamically assigns different `Vehicle` objects to a common reference and invokes the overridden `start()` method at runtime.  

### 🏗 **Concepts Used**  
✅ Interface in Java (`Vehicle`)  
✅ Method Overriding  
✅ Dynamic Polymorphism (Runtime Polymorphism)  
✅ Abstraction  

### 📂 **Project Structure**  
```
📦 VehiclePolymorphism
 ┣ 📜 Vehicle.java       # Interface defining vehicle behavior
 ┣ 📜 Car.java           # Car class implementing Vehicle
 ┣ 📜 Bike.java          # Bike class implementing Vehicle
 ┣ 📜 Truck.java         # Truck class implementing Vehicle
 ┗ 📜 VehicleTest.java   # Main class demonstrating polymorphism
```

### 🎯 **How to Run the Program**  
1. Clone the repository or download the files.  
2. Compile all Java files using:  
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the program:  
   ```
   java VehicleTest
   ```
4. Expected Output:  
   ```
   Car is starting with a key ignition.
   Bike is starting with a self-start button.
   Truck is starting with a heavy-duty engine switch.
   ```

### 🚀 **Why Use Dynamic Polymorphism?**  
- Improves **code reusability** and **scalability**  
- Reduces **code duplication**  
- Enables **flexibility** in handling multiple object types through a single reference
