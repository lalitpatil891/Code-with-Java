Develop a scenario based program by using Multithreading for OLA cab booking
process

Create 6 BLC classes which extending from Thread OR Anonymous inner class
approach which are as follows :

1) RideRequest
2) DriverAssignment
3) FareCalculation
4) LiveTracking
5) PaymentProcessing   
6) RatingSystem

Instruction :
-------------
Override run() method in all the above classes

a) run() method implementation for RideRequest class :
   It should print a message "User requested a ride...". User should wait
   for 2 seconds, after that, It should print a message "Searching for nearby drivers..."
   
b) run() method implementation for DriverAssignment class
   It should wait for 3 seconds and then print a message "Driver found and assigned!"
   
c) run() method implementation for FareCalculation class
   It should print a message "Calculating estimated fare...", Here Thread
   should wait for 1.5 second and then it should print "Estimated fare: 135.75 RS."

d) run() method implementation for LiveTracking class
   Here you should write the logic to update the ride location in % [See the
   output Test cases for more details]
   After that it should print a message "Ride Completed".
    
e) run() method implementation for PaymentProcessing class :
   It should print a message "Processing payment..." Here Thread should 
   wait for 2 seconds then It should print "Payment successful!"

f) run() method implementation for RatingSystem class :  
   It should print a message "Requesting user rating...". Here Thread should
   wait for 1 second and It should print "User rated the ride: 5 star"


 
 Create an ELC class called OlaRidingApp.
 
 Inside main method Create the object for all 6 six classes using Ordinary
 Or Anonymous inner class approach :
     
  Instruction :
  
  a) start RideRequest and FareCalculation thread together
  b) call join() method on RideRequest thread
  
  Note : In the same use start() and join() to get the following output : 
       
  
  Test Cases for Output :
  ------------------------
  User requested a ride...
	Calculating estimated fare...
	Estimated fare: 135.75 RS.
	Searching for nearby drivers...
	Driver found and assigned!
	Updating ride location... 20% completed
	Updating ride location... 40% completed
	Updating ride location... 60% completed
	Updating ride location... 80% completed
	Updating ride location... 100% completed
	Ride completed!
	Processing payment...
	Payment successful!
	Requesting user rating...
	User rated the ride: 5 star
