## [Shape and Hospital Management System](https://github.com/lalitpatil891/CodeWithJava/tree/main/Shape%20and%20Hospital%20Management%20System)
"DateOfAssingment: 27-DEC-2024".

## Question 1: Shape Hierarchy

### Problem Statement

Implement a class `Shape` with three subclasses: `Circle`, `Triangle`, and `Square`. Each class should have `draw()` and `erase()` methods that override the base class methods. The `Shape` class should also have a `randshape()` method that randomly generates an instance of one of the subclasses.

### Implementation Details

- `Shape` is the base class with default `draw()` and `erase()` methods.
- `Circle`, `Triangle`, and `Square` override these methods with specific behavior.
- `randshape()` generates a random shape instance.
- The `ShapeDemo` class contains the `main` method to test the implementation.

### How to Run

1. Compile and run `ShapeDemo.java`.
2. Observe the random shape generation and method overriding in action.

---

## Question 2: Hospital Management System

### Problem Statement

Design a Hospital Management System using inheritance. Create a base class `HospitalStaff` with `name`, `age`, and `role` attributes, and a `work()` method. Extend this class into `Doctor` and `Nurse` with specific attributes and method overrides.

### Implementation Details

- `HospitalStaff` is the base class with a `work()` method.
- `Doctor` extends `HospitalStaff` and includes a `specialization` attribute.
- `Nurse` extends `HospitalStaff` and includes `yearsOfExperience`.
- The `HospitalManagementSystem` class contains the `main` method to test the implementation.

### How to Run

1. Compile and run `HospitalManagementSystem.java`.
2. Observe role-based behavior using method overriding.

### üöñ [OLA Cab Booking Process - Multithreading in Java]()    
"DateOfAssingment: 30-JAN-2025".

This project simulates an OLA Cab Booking Process using multithreading in Java. It consists of six different classes that extend the Thread class (or use anonymous inner classes). Each thread represents a different stage in the cab booking process.

### üìå Classes and Their Functionalities

1. **üöó RideRequest**
   - Prints: "User requested a ride..."
   - Waits for 2 seconds
   - Prints: "Searching for nearby drivers..."

2. **üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è DriverAssignment**
   - Waits for 3 seconds
   - Prints: "Driver found and assigned!"

3. **üí∞ FareCalculation**
   - Prints: "Calculating estimated fare..."
   - Waits for 1.5 seconds
   - Prints: "Estimated fare: 135.75 RS."

4. **üìç LiveTracking**
   - Prints the ride progress in 20% increments
   - Prints: "Ride Completed!"

5. **üí≥ PaymentProcessing**
   - Prints: "Processing payment..."
   - Waits for 2 seconds
   - Prints: "Payment successful!"

6. **‚≠ê RatingSystem**
   - Prints: "Requesting user rating..."
   - Waits for 1 second
   - Prints: "User rated the ride: 5 star"

### üîÑ Execution Order

- RideRequest and FareCalculation start together
- `join()` is called on RideRequest to ensure it completes before proceeding
- Threads execute sequentially following the natural order of ride processing

### üìú Expected Output

```
User requested a ride...
Calculating estimated fare...
Estimated fare: 135.75 RS.
Searching for nearby drivers...
Driver found and assigned!
Updating ride location... 20% completed

# [Employee Management System](https://github.com/lalitpatil891/CodeWithJava/tree/main/enum%20In%20java/Employee%20Management%20System)

## Overview
This Java program demonstrates an Employee Management System with inheritance, method overriding, and enums. It includes the following classes:

- **Employee**: Base class with attributes like name, employee ID, and salary.
- **Manager**: Subclass of Employee with an additional type (HR or Sales) and customized salary logic.
- **Clerk**: Subclass of Employee with attributes for typing speed and accuracy, with conditional salary bonuses.
- **ManagerType**: Enum defining manager types (HR, SALES).
- **EmployeeTester**: Main class to test the functionalities.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- Method overriding for salary adjustments.
- Enum usage for Manager types.
- Conditional logic for Clerk salary bonuses.

## Program Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Employee.java
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manager.java
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clerk.java
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ManagerType.java
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EmployeeTester.java
```

## Usage
1. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java EmployeeTester
   ```

3. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   HR Manager Salary: 60000.0
   Sales Manager Salary: 55000.0
   Clerk Salary (initial): 30000.0
   Clerk Salary (after qualifying): 31000.0
   Clerk Salary (after further improvement): 31000.0
   ```

## How It Works
- **Manager**: Overrides `setSalary()` to add:
  - 10,000 for HR managers.
  - 5,000 for Sales managers.

- **Clerk**:
  - Earns a 1,000 bonus if typing speed > 70 and accuracy > 80.
  - Bonus is applied only once even if speed/accuracy improves further.
