### How It Works
1. The program takes input for `n`, the number of sentences.
2. It then reads `n` sentences and splits them into words while converting them to lowercase.
3. The words are added to a list, preserving their original order.
4. Using Java Streams and `distinct()`, duplicate words are removed.
5. The final list of unique words is printed as output.

### Dependencies
- Java SE 8 or higher
- A Java compiler (e.g., `javac`)

## [Odd Numbers Square Generator]()

### Description
This Java program generates an infinite stream of odd numbers using `Stream.iterate()` and computes the square of each odd number up to a given limit `N`. The squared values are collected into a list and printed as output.

### How It Works
1. Reads an integer `N` from user input.
2. Generates an infinite stream of odd numbers starting from `1`.
3. Limits the stream to only odd numbers up to `N`.
4. Maps each odd number to its square.
5. Collects the squared values into a list and prints them.

### Sample Input/Output
### Input:
```
10
```
### Output:
```
[1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
```

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Streams API (`Stream.iterate()`, `map()`, `collect()`)

### How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```
   javac OddNumbersSquare.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   java OddNumbersSquare
   ```
3. Enter a number as input when prompted.

## [StartWithVowelAndLengthGreaterThanFive]()

### Description
This Java program processes a list of words and filters out the ones that:
1. Start with a vowel (case-insensitive).
2. Have a length greater than 5 characters.

The filtered words are collected and printed as output.

### How It Works
1. Reads an integer `N` from user input, representing the number of words.
2. Reads `N` words from input.
3. Uses Java Streams to filter words based on:
   - First character being a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u` in any case).
   - Length greater than 5.
4. Collects and prints the filtered words.

## Sample Input/Output
### Input:
```
5
Aeroplane
apple
egg
Dog
Orange
```
### Output:
```
[Aeroplane, apple, Orange]
```

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Streams API (`filter()`, `collect()`)
- Regular Expressions for filtering

### How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```
   javac StartWithVowel.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   java StartWithVowel
   ```
3. Enter the number of words and the words themselves.

## [SortByLengthAndLexicographically]()

### Description
This Java program sorts a list of words based on:
1. Length (shorter words appear first).
2. Lexicographical order (case-insensitive) if words have the same length.

### How It Works
1. Reads an integer `N` from user input, representing the number of words.
2. Reads `N` words from input.
3. Uses Java Streams to sort words:
   - First by length (`Comparator.comparingInt(String::length)`).
   - Then lexicographically (`thenComparing(String::compareToIgnoreCase)`).
4. Collects and prints the sorted words.

### Sample Input/Output
### Input:
```
5
Apple
ball
ant
Banana
dog
```
### Output:
```
[Apple, Banana, ant, ball, dog]
```

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Streams API (`sorted()`, `collect()`)
- Comparator chaining for sorting

### How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```
   javac SortByLengthAndLexicographically.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   java SortByLengthAndLexicographically
   ```
3. Enter the number of words and the words themselves.
