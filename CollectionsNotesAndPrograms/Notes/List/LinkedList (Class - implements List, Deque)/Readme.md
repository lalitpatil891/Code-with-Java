**ArrayList → It is a Dynamic Array.**

* Access/Search is fast (**O(1)**).
* Insert/Delete is slow (**O(n)**, because shifting is required).
* Uses less memory.

**LinkedList → It is a Doubly Linked List.**

* Access/Search is slow (**O(n)**).
* Insert/Delete is fast (**O(1)**, just changing links).
* Consumes more memory (data + next + prev references).

**Use case:**

* If Reading/Search is frequent → **ArrayList**
* If Insert/Delete is frequent → **LinkedList**
