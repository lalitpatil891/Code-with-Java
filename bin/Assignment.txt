Assignment  (17 DEC 2024)
Question-1
--------------
Create a BLC class Named as Shape and it have three sub classes named as Circle, Triangle and Square
for each class we have two methods called as draw() and erase()

For Shape class

Methods:
public static Shape randshape()
No Argument constructor
randshape(): Using switch ((int) (Math.random()*3))
case 0: create an object for Circle Object using return
case 1: create an object for Square Object using return
case 2: create an object for Triangle Object using return
default: Print as default message
finally return an object for Shape class
Use this class to test your solution's class and methods in main method

For Shape class
Methods: In draw():void and erase():void and No argument constructor
draw(): print "shape draw"
erase(): print "Shape erase"
For Circle class sub class of Shape class
Methods: In draw():void and erase():void and No argument constructor
Override:
draw() method print "Circle draw" and erase() method print "Circle erase"

For Triangle class sub class of Shape class

Take No argument constructor

Methods:

In draw():void
 erase():void
Override:
draw() method print "Triangle draw" and erase() method print "Triangle erase"


For Square class sub class of Shape class

Take No argument constructor

Methods:
 draw():void
 erase():void

Override:
draw() method print "Square draw" and erase() method print "Square erase"



Create Main class(ELC Class) named as ShapeDemo and havinf main method and call the method and execute it.

Test Cases -1 :
-------------------
Valid Case: Random Shape Generation

Sample Input: [No input needed]
Expected Output (example run, actual output will vary due to randomness):

Triangle draw
Triangle erase

Square draw
Square erase

Circle draw
Circle erase

Circle draw
Circle erase

---------------
Question-2
---------------
 Design a  Java program that models a Hospital Management System using inheritance:

Create class HospitalStaff with following attributes

declare variable:

private String name;
private int age;
private String role;

create one parameterized Constructor and initialize values

method Name:- work()
Access modifier :-public
return type:-void

this method will print the role and there name with "is working massage"

*create second class Doctor which will inherited with HospitalStaff

declare variable:
private String specialization;

 take one parameterized Constructor and initialize values

// Overriding work() method for doctors
it will print Roll and Name with this massage" with specialization in " + specialization + " is treating patient
s."

* Create Nurse class which will inherite HospitalStaff

Variables :-
private int yearsOfExperience;

take  one parameterized Constructor and initialize values

// Overriding work() method for nurses
it will print massage in this format
Role + " " + NAME + " with " + yearsOfExperience + " years of experience is taking care of patients."

create class HospitalManagementSystem inside this take main method where use this class for testing
create object for every class and check
