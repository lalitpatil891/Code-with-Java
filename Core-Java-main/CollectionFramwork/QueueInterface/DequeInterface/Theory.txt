1) Definition:      A double-ended queue that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.

2) Order:           Can be used as a FIFO queue or a LIFO stack.

3) Null Elements:   Depends on the implementation (e.g., ArrayDeque does not allow null).

4) When to Use:     When you need a double-ended queue (insert/remove from both ends).


******Implementations:*******

1) ArrayDeque:

        1) Definition: A resizable array implementation of the Deque interface.

        2) Performance: Provides O(1) time complexity for add(), remove(), and peek() operations.

        3) When to Use: When you need a resizable array implementation of a double-ended queue.

2) LinkedList:

        1) Definition: A doubly-linked list implementation of the Deque interface.

        2) Performance: Provides O(1) time complexity for add(), remove(), and peek() operations.

        3) When to Use: When you need a linked list implementation of a double-ended queue.



***********When to Use Which Queue Implementation?**********

     (Queue Implementation)	                                (When to Use)
    1) PriorityQueue	                             When you need elements processed based on priority.
    2) ArrayDeque	                                 When you need a resizable array implementation of a double-ended queue.
    3) LinkedList	                                 When you need a linked list implementation of a double-ended queue.


******* Key Differences Between Queue Implementations *******

(Feature)	    (PriorityQueue)	                (ArrayDeque)	                             (LinkedList)
Order	        Priority-based	                FIFO or LIFO	                              FIFO or LIFO
Null Elements	Not allowed	                    Not allowed	                                  Allowed
Performance 	O(log n) for add/poll	        O(1) for add/remove/peek	                  O(1) for add/remove/peek
Use Case	    Priority-based queue	        Double-ended queue	                          Double-ended queue
